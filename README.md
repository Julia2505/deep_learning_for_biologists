# Deep Learning for Biologists with Keras



## By whom?

Yosuke Toda (tyosuke-at-aquaseerser.com)

JST PRESTO researcher at Nagoya Univeristy /  Agri-Heir Co., Ltd.



## What is it?

- Tutorials that can run deep learning based analysis  (mainly) of biological relavent themes. Should give you (biologists) a better implementation of DL much more than general tutorial tasks like MNIST and CIFAR-10. (Although going to prepare basic tutorial section on how to use colab and keras with such in the future)
- Google Colaboratory based notebooks. All you need is internet connection, google chrome browser, and google account. **GPU learning environment at a click!**
- To open the notebook, click on the ![image](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)button in each section. Logged in to Google Account and copying the ipynb to your local google doc folder is preferred.

## Note

- Mathmatical calculations and/or theoretical backgrounds will not be thoroughly explained in this tutorial. The object of this notebook is to get a overview of how we can perform DL in the field of biology (especially in plant science and agriculture) for non informatitians.

- **Keras with Tensorflow background** is the main DL framework used in the notebook. I do not intend to mix different frameworks for clarity in the current situation.
- Feedbacks and requests, complements including typos and misusage of codes in the notebooks are highly welcomed in the issues of github repo.
