# Deep Learning for Biologists with Keras



## What is it?

- Google Colaboratory based notebooks.

- Tutorial that can run deep learning based analysis  (mainly) of biological relavent themes

## Note

- Mathmatical calculations and/or theoretical backgrounds will not be thoroughly explained in this tutorial. The object of this notebook is to get a overview of how we can perform DL in the field of biology (especially in plant science and agriculture) for non informatitians.

- **Keras with Tensorflow background** is the main DL framework used in the notebook. I do not intend to mix different frameworks for clarity in the current situation.

- Feedbacks and requests, complements including typos and misusage of codes in the notebooks are highly welcomed in the issues of github repo.
